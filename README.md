Predicting all-Cause 30-Day ICU Readmissions
Using Robust Feature Selection

Abstractâ€”Immature ICU discharge leads to early readmission. Most of the ICU early readmissions can be avoided and
a significant amount of treatment costs can be saved. To be
able to successfully predict readmission, prediction model should
be interpretable so that the issues ignored while discharging
a patient from ICU are properly identified. Complex machine
learning models are not easily interpretable and consequently
they are ineffective for clinicians. Therefore, our aim was to
develop a prediction model which achieves a high discriminating
characteristic and also is interpretable enough so it can be used to
prevent the occurrence of early readmissions. In this project, we
separated feature selection and modeling steps to build a robust
predictive pipeline to predict 30-day all-cause ICU readmissions.
Our model identified 24 highly predictive features which at best
achieved prediction with 90% accuracy using simple logistic
regression.
